Everything is running very smoothly on it except for a couple things: 1. Whenever I go to the start menu and hit shutdown, my computer will shut down for about 5 seconds and then boot back up. It's as if the computer thinks I am telling it to restart instead of shutdown. I've just been shutting down and in the 5 seconds it is off, flipping the switch on my power supply. I don't like doing this, but I don't know what else to do. I've noticed. Статья о ремонте видеомагнитофонов фирмы Panasonic серий SD, HD, HS и. В статье приводится описание.

So the latest version of the Intel Chipset drivers is 10.0.26 but even from the the release notes I can't tell if it actually supports the Z87 chipset. The driver page for my Z87-A was pretty much abandoned immediately after the board was released so nothing on that page is up to date. I went about finding the latest versions when I installed Windows 8.1 last year. The latest version of the Intel Chipset drivers that I could find on the Intel site the actually stated Быстрая установка драйверов на Bluetooth – это возможно.

Hi everyone, I'm a lifelong console gamer wanting to build my first PC. I understand the components of a PC but am not familiar at all with the superiorities of varying models and brands. My aim: build a PC which a) can play any game out today at Max/Ultra settings at 1080p for my beautiful Panny plasma and a frame rate of 60 fps, hopefully closer to 90 b) is quite future proof. I own a PS3 and PS4 (bought because of exclusives and I love PS+). I'll use the PC mainly for future release titles.

I've tried every single solution I've found online to no avail (reinstalling the game, completely reinstalling display drivers, disabled full screen optimizations, completely ~~removed~~ disabled game DVR) #I will stress that this only happens ONLINE  I get over 300 fps when playing with bots.

Older driver interference is sadly not the issue, given that it a fresh installation of Windows 8.1 was tried as well, which of course would have no driver history whatsoever.

Hi guys. My dad recently built himself a new PC and gave me his old one. I've been mucking around on it the last few days and something just doesn't feel right. It feels sluggish, with some random stutters and the fan intermittently sounding like it's going in to hyperspace. It struggles to play most games on even a medium setting, but maybe that's normal for the specs, I don't really know. I have done a full wipe and fresh install, and all drivers are 100% up to date. These are the results. I start a typical comp game at around 220-240FPS and when the game starts and enemies come from spawn and such, my fps drops around 120-140 FPS. I need my fps to always be above 144, preferably as high as possible for my 144hz monitor. Specs: OS: Windows 10 Pro 64-Bit CPU: Intel i7 4770 @ 3.4GHz RAM: 16GB Single-channel DDR3 @ 800MHz (May believe this is halfed due to how the OS reads it compared to the BIOS) Motherboard: Gigabyte Z87-HD3 (Socket 0) GPU: Nvidia Geforce 1070 Storage. I have an Asus GeForce STRIX 970 4GB I'm trying to get to work with a PC. My problem is that I get "no signal detected" on the display when I have it plugged in and " "Initiate Graphic Adapter" is set to PEG instead of IGD (only these two options in BIOS). It is detected in both the BIOS Board Explorer and in the Device Manager when plugged in and I've booted with IGD. Anyone knows anything I can try to get it to work except what I've done and what I still haven't done? amp#x200B; Hi, When I watch youtube videos or Twitch streams, my audio cuts out randomly for around 2 seconds.

So I've been running my gaming PC for a while now, upgrading as I go. Current specs are: Motherboard: MSI z87-gd65 CPU: i5-4670k RAM: 16GB DDR3 Graphics Card: Radeon R9 380 Peripherals: Wifi amp bluetooth dongles, PCI usb expansion cards Drives: SSD and HDD OS: Windows 10 amp#x200B; Recently the system has been crashing very frequently, the only thing that I've changed in the expansion cards and a new screen. There seems to be two different types of crashes: A BSOD with the error. Issue I am experiencing serious issues with a desktop computer I built. Most of the cases, the computer does not boots up, the power is on, HDD on, fans running but the screen remains black. Nonetheless, the computer does boot in some rare occasions after waiting a few day without trying to turn it on. Optional Clues Most surprisingly, I replaced the CMOS battery and got it to work perfectly for an entire day (I could turn it on and off), which highly confuses me since the battery. 
This is more of a tech issue than anything. I've actually had a great time getting second place with my team and lol-ing at the hacking.

I now think this is terrible advice for a lot of hobbyists. Worse, in a strange sort of Stockholm syndrome, contrary opinions are shouted down.

So, clearly Chrome and Android are lacking in the areas of robust photo and video editors. And this is largely by design as these are not content creation machines. In the past, I have used Google Photos, and moved on with life. However, recently I have been developing an itch to do a little more. Not Final Cut Pro or Photoshop more.

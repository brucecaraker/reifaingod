                            <p>Hello, I am running Solus 4. I was using a Linksys USB wifi stick that there are no current drivers for in Linux, so I bought a TP-Link stick on Amazon that I read had good compatibility. I have downloaded the driver from the manufacturer's website here (https://www.tp-link.com/us/support/download/tl-wn821n/#Driver). I am also following the instructions provided by the manufacturer here (https://static.tp-link.com/2018/201812/20181207/Installation%20Guide%20for%20Linux.pdf). It is telling. Will I be able to plug in the TP-Link TL-WN821N and connect to the internet with Windows 10, without having to download the driver because I don't know how to install disk drivers. For the last few years I've used a USB Network Adapter to get wifi to my PC. About a week ago, after setting my PC up after it was in storage for a couple of months, I started running into issues where my internet connection will randomly cut out, whilst still having full bars of wifi. When I "diagnose this connection" the problem detected is "The default gateway is not available", however the diagnosis tool says this is "fixed". The internet then works for a very short time, however the problem. Hello, i'm trying to use an old laptop which doesn't have Ethernet support and can't boot from USB. I can't even install the OS on a separate machine because it's an IDE drive and i don't have an adapter. So, since i have an USB Wi-Fi adapter, i was looking for a distro that: \- Has built-in drivers for USB Wi-Fi Adapters (specifically TP-LINK TL-WN821N) \- Fits in a CD (700MB max) \- And finally, can run fine in a 64 MB RAM system amp#x200B; Any distro that fullfills these requirements. I was using a cable to connect to my internet, then I couldn't do that anymore because we moved the modem to a diffrent room, and I am connecting through a TL-WN821N (TP-Link's WiFi adaptor) I had it for a few years but, sometimes randomly, It started happening less after I went through 15-16 solutions on the internet, It just says limited access and I am not able to use it anymore. Doesn't happen on Phone's WiFi or in Laptop. It's just my pc, I'm guessing its maybe because of the TP-Link's. -Windows 7 Home 64 Bit -Asus R9270X GPU -AMD FX-8320 8 core CPU -Crucial MX300 275gb SSD -Two 4gb Hyperx Ram sticks I hope throwing two problems into the same post isn't violating any laws here, but i feel they could be connected to one thing. I'll explain. Last month, my HDD in my 2014 PC Build essentially failed, and after transferring everything important onto a laptop, i bought the SSD shown in the specs. Obviously, this meant i had to reinstall the operating system, and since I'll keep a long story short: I had to wipe a family computer after malware got on it which I did via deleting the HDD Partitions but leaving the manufacturer partition since it was a prebuilt. I reinstalled Windows 10 on a new partition, and everything was working fine, until I attempted to use it for voice chat services. I use Push-to-talk in Discord and randomly when I press my PTT hotkey and begin to speak, sometimes my PC freezes and gives me a BSOD with the error code "DPC_Watchdog_Violati. Specs Processor: AMD FX(tm)-8320 Eight-Core Processor RAM: 8GB GPU: NVIDIA GTX 760 OS Windows 7 Model Number of Wireless USB Adapter: TL-WN821N Recently moved to a university hall and, as Ethernet is not available to us, I was forced to buy a wireless USB adapter if I wanted internet. I can happily connect to the University network however I cannot access the internet in any way. ================== When I attempt to connect to the Uni network it gives 
I bought this second hand PC a week ago and the wifi adapter arrived today. This is what I'm getting when I try to enable it. https://imgur.com/gallery/BFlZ3 I've tried the adapter in all of the different USB ports and I've tried reinstalling drivers and restarting my computer many times. Pls help I want to play video games :( Specs Wifi adapter: TP-link TL-WN821N i5 2500 8gb DDR3 1333MHz Edit: I fixed it by spoofing my MAC address For 2 days now i have been unable to connect to the internet (i am connected to the router). I am connected using Ethernet, however when i tried using a wifi USB to connect it did not work. The only time i can connect is when i'm using my hotspot (through the Wifi USB). Every other device i have can connect and use the internet I have literally tried everything that comes up on google (flushing DNS, Resetting Winsock, the 'netsh' b.s, reinstalling. I've got a problem with tp link wifi adapter - I need to pass it to VirtualBox (with extension pack and all) but the adapter is not recognized by the system. It is in lsusb Bus 003 Device 002: ID 0bda:8178 Realtek Semiconductor Corp. but not in the lshw so I suppose the drivers are missing or not working. I followed steps from ubuntu forum Hi, New to this sub so sorry if this is in the wrong place etc. I've just built my first computer, and I've got a weird problem with the wireless card. The card is a TP-Link WDN4800, using the standard driver/utility from their website. Even when using applications that require constant connection (such as youtube, live streams, games etc), the connection is consistently dropping down to 0kbps upload/download. Here ( is a screenshot showing exactly what is happening. So, i've been trying to install manually the driver from this hardware ( the site is in portuguese i'm going to search for a and since the computer i want to download in can't connect to the internet (because it needs the hardware) i downloaded the driver in my notebook and tried to pass it to the cpu that needs it, when i tried to install it, the system told me that the file wasn't for win 7 32bit, so i thought that i had passed the driver. Hai guys ^^ As stated above, I have a "small" problem with my TP-LINK TL-WN821N Wifi USB adapter. I recently built a new PC, put Windows 8.1 Pro 64bits on it (thanks Dreamspark) and installed all the drivers and utilities from my 2 CDs coming with my motherboard and my GPU. Sadly, I'd like to install other software and utilities (such as Java and other), but without my Wifi USB adapter, I can't connect on my home network. My PC doesn't have a Wifi card in it (I kinda forgot that detail. So, I bought a TP-Link TL-WN821N WiFi adapter for my desktop to be able to use to connect wirelessly(obviously) but so far I've had nothing but problems. Its constantly disconnecting me. I read that using windows wireless drivers instead of the TP-Link drivers fixes

So I just recently bought myself a raspberry pi 2. So far I am loving it, but I have run into a bit of a problem I have this Wifi Dongle, that works with my regular windows PC. I plug it into my pi and followed a few guides online in attempt to get it working. But came up with no luck. What I know my raspberry pi recognizes my wifi dongle my wifi dongle's specification is Atheros Communications, Inc. TP-Link TL-WN821N v2 / TL-WN822N v1 802.11n Atheros AR9170 Since I have started using this TP-Link Wireless adapter ( my Windows 7 64 bit computer has been crashing relentlessly. I wiped my hard drive, reinstalled Windows, and everything worked fine after days of testing. I installed the TP-Link adapter again using the most updated driver and a few days later, sure enough, my computer is spontaneously blue screening on me. Supposedly this adapter worked with Windows. I purchased a TP-Link TL-WN821N (its a USB wifi adapter), and it seems to be causing my computer to blue screen. Before I installed the drivers, I had no problems at all, and once I installed them the adapter seemed to work great! However, after restarting my computer to install updates, it seems to be randomly blue screening anywhere from 30 seconds to 5 minutes after startup (error code is 0x000000E1 if that helps). I am almost sure that it is the driver that is causing this problem, because. 中关村在线tp-link无线网卡驱动下载专区提供tp-link tl-wn610g,tp-link tl-wn725n,tp-link tl-wn322g+,tp-link tl-wn620g,tp-link tl-wn721n,tp-link tl-wn821n.

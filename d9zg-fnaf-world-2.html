it has been many years since anything has happened in animatronica, or at least to they player it has been, the world kind of froze after that whole "Baby incident" happened. Now we return. Fredbear is sick of us not being there but he catches us up on what happened. It turns out that we will have to traverse the world of animatronica to find Circus Baby and take her down. (or join our team) However , just like there are glitches to go down into the code, there are breaches to traverse upwards. I'll start this off by saying this: I don't like FNaF World. The overworld is really cluttered (the perspective effect does not look good), the story sucks (for the most part), the characters are barely characters, ect. ect. Even though the game has many flaws I feel like a remake or sequel would fix them and truly make it a great game. The humor in Update 2 and the Mobile port is hilarious and the whole of Update 2 elevated the game to another level. The FNaF 6 buyable characters would really. Just as the title suggests, I will dedicate my time today for the 2 year anniversary of FNaF World to do a speedrunning marathon strean where I will play the various categories made by me and my buddies over at speedrun.com (Mainly the category extensions) on YouTube and just have a good time with the game that I started running since July 25th 2017. I was first drawn into the game on the 20th of July just 5 days earlier after I seemed to drop off the face of the fandom 3 days after MY BAD: NOT 2.0. ITS 1.1. Really sorry for or stealing the thunder but there's some confusion and I didn't feel like any of the current threads should be stickied. HUGE shoutout to /u/DaveA62 for getting the first post on this subject. FNaF world 1.1 has been released. If you own the game, it will auto update on Steam. The FULL FNaF World game 1.1 has been released on Gamejolt: Yeah, I know it's a bit of a strech but think about it. It could be based on the same furmula, but since it's brand new, it could be a thousland times better. Better: Story Map design Battle design Character development Ways to spend your FazTokens and more. I mean, it's probably not gonna happen but hey bear with me I still haven't completely digested Coffee's Revenge. So everyone lately knows about the ScottGames amp Fnafworld conversation.what if scotts teasing a Fnaf World 2? I know that possibilty is.very very very very low because of how badly the first game Flopped. But hey who knows, Scott works in mysterious ways. Also i know hes most likely teasing the fnaf movie with the website conversation you dont need to point that out in the comments. Just wanted to show my little theory. You get to fight PG, yeah pretty expected. But when you beat him, he will say "heh,you're going to regret that.", and then he transforms into the ultimate, industructible, PURPLEGEIST. He would have a REALLY epic boss theme in his battle, and he would be imune to every attack you do, and have super strong attacks, he would even instantly destroy you're teamates, then, when all of you're teamates are destroyed/killed. he will seem like to kill you're lead party member, he realizes he forgot. Maybe if enough fans request, Scott will listen. I could make a song out of that.

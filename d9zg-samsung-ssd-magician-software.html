I was wondering if it would be a good idea to use the Samsung SSD Magician software for SSD maintenance? I use it for my other PC where I bought and installed a new Samsung drive. Will using it on my Dell conflict with any of the Dell settings? I know that they use some sort of weird RAID configuration. Level up Performance.

The latest V-NAND—which brings greater NAND performance and higher power efficiency—along with optimized firmware, a proven Phoenix controller, and Intelligent TurboWrite boost. Hey guys, As title says. Every time I power on my computer it boots straight to BIOS. But I read somewhere that you could unplug the SSD datacable, power on the computer for 30 minutes, turn it off for 30 seconds, turn it on for another 30 minutes and once again turn off the power. Connect the datacable and turn on the pc. It works every time I do that. In the long run, that’s not viable. Samsung SSD magician software is showing my SSD health is good.

Must be all of those Windows I'm in the market for an SSD to upgrade my PC, and with christmas coming up it seems like a good time. I've been looking at the Samsung 830 256gb, as I hear them recommended more than the Crucial M4. Also, how is the Samsung SSD magician software? Thanks for your time/replies I just installed my new Samsung 830 128GB SSD yesterday and set up Windows and installed all of my drivers and programs that I need. Afterwards I ran the Samsung SSD Magician software that came with the SSD and it gave me a download for new firmware. How do I install this new firmware and does it involve having My first SSD arrived yesterday (256GB 840 Pro) and it'll be replacing the current drive in my laptop (Core i3-370M, 8GB RAM, 250GB 7200rpm). I'll be doing a fresh install of Windows 8, and came across a lot of guides for older SSD's and Windows 7 specific tweaks. I'm hoping this guide ( is all I'll need, but I'm just curious if they're missing anything. I'm assuming since it's a recent SSD paired 
Ok, so i've yanked the HDD out of my laptop from this post (https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcvideoediting/comments/adsgi4/which_drives_to_use_for_what/), and replaced it with another SSD. Crystal Disk has returned some interesting results: https://imgur.com/a/aAJPgct (https://imgur.com/a/aAJPgct) amp#x200B; It's possible that the caddy i have placed my third SSD into is causing some kind of limitation, (or something is otherwise fucky) as it is an 860 EVO and should be performing slightly. Hey, I've had my PC with the same set up for 4 years and no problems. The other day I thought I'd try out the software that came with my SSD and it recommended I do something called "OS Optimisation". So I picked the option of maximised capacity as I was running out of storage on it. I then went to play a game of fortnite and the game crashed because of memory problems. I tried out all the settings and the one that worked was the maximum performance option (note I couldn't find an option Hi all, As the title says. I've spent hours combing through my registry, devices and scheduled tasks whilst killing any app I suspected of keeping my PC idle; only to discover that it was bloody Samsung Magician. Nothing would show up in CMD for wake or power requests at all (of course I had rectified anything that had), I had unplugged each USB item in sequence to test the idle state and still nothing. If this helps anyone at all, then I'm happy. Cheers. I don't understand. My main issue is Samsung Magician software. All I want to do is format it to NTFS and make it up to date firmware. This is my first SSD drive. I plug the SSD into windows and the Magician software says drive not compatible. This is the setup latest version for EVO 860 (https://ynzzy74688.i.lithium.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/2771i9F4912D644427313/image-size/large?v=1.0amppx=999). While the other version is different looking (https://www.storagereview.com/images/Stora. I have an Alienware 17 R15 (i7, 16gb ram, 256 sdd, 1tb hdd, GTX 1070). I just purchased another 16gb of RAM ( I am glad only 1 slot was used). I purchased Crucial memory, almost identical in specifications as the Samsung that is in there from Dell. After I added the RAM, do I need to change anything in the BIOS or will it recognize it automatically? I furthermore purchased a 1tb Samsung 970 EVO (M.2) to compliment the Toshiba drive already in there (installed in SSD slot 3). My question, Should. Hey guys I am trying to figure out whether I should RMA my SSD or not because I believe that the IOPS numbers are a bit on the low side. Screenshot of the Samsung benchmark: https://i.imgur.com/ZpoQLyA.png I also did a couple of other benchmarks and they all show different results. Could someone with the same drive run the Samsung magician benchmark and post the results here? I would be really grateful, thanks. PS: I got the 500 GB version. Just got my paycheck from working this summer, and I'm planning on buying an SSD to put Windows and some steam games on it. I know how to put steam games on it, but how do I move Windows? Edit: Planning on getting 
I recently got a Samsung 960 EVO m.2 250gb. In the small box there is a leaflet about getting Samsung Magician. Is this actually beneficial? Are there any major cons to not ever installing. Hello Guys, I recently added a new drive (Samsung 950 pro m.2 nvme 512g ssd) to my new Alienware 17-r4 gaming laptop. And I used paragon migration software to migrate my OS from the source drive (Sandisk X400 m) to the new drive and configured the new drive as the boot drive in BIOS. Everything went smoothly except the source drive still has the OS files on it. So I don't know if i should delete the files on the source drive. But that's not my main issue. The main issue is that after the upgra. First time posting here, it's just in hopes that it helps somebody. Assuming I'm not the last person in the sub to find out. Found out by accident, a friend mentioned how if I have an 840, the Magician program has lots to offer. It's really isn't like "one of those" that come with h/w. Followed his advice, and was pleasantly surprised! Have a look. https://imgur.com/a/Frl2O. There use to be a feature to set aside some disk space for the SSD provisioning or something along those lines? I remember it would reduce the lifespan of the disk drive if you didn't create it. I forget exactly what the name of it was, but the newer software seems to be missing it. Is that no longer relevant. Hi /r/buildapc I have two solid state drives in my desktop and I wanted to have a discussion about them. I've heard a lot of hype about Samsung drives, and about how even though they are more expensive, the extra cost is worth it. However, looking at CDM, I'm not seeing the incredible synthetic performance that I was expecting, hearing the legends. Here are the two drives: PCPartPicker part list (https://pcpartpicker.com/list/xrP4cf) / Price breakdown by merchant (https://pcpartpicker. Hello all, Samsung Magician used to work perfectly fine on my PC, but it has stopped working for seemingly no reason (about a month ago, and i've ignored it up until now when there is talk of needing to upgrade firmware due to the issue with slow speeds on old data). When trying to open Magician, it says: gt"Magician" has encountered an error and cannot continue. Press 'OK' to launch the application again or 'Cancel' to quit the application. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling 
So for Christmas I will be getting a 500gb Samsung SSD. Right now I have a 1TB WD Blue Hard drive. I want to use my SSD to boot my bigger games and OS while using my HDD for programs and files. What would be the easiest way to transfer my OS and games to my SSD? I greatly appreciate I just want 512GB SSD + 1TB Storage. is this option totally not available or do I have to go for Alienware 15? I travel a lot so size does matter.
